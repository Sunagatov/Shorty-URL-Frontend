## What this project is

Shorty URL Frontend is a React + TypeScript single-page application for the Shorty URL platform.

It allows users to:

- create shortened URLs
- sign up and sign in with email/password
- browse and manage their own URL mappings
- view URL details
- use authenticated account pages protected by route guards
- run unit, component, and Playwright E2E tests in a modern Vite-based setup

This project communicates with the Shorty URL backend via REST API.

## Testing

### Unit / component tests

```bash
npm run test
```

### E2E tests

```bash
npm run test:e2e
```

### Important E2E note

The E2E suite expects a working backend with the expected authentication and URL APIs.

By default:

- frontend runs on `http://localhost:3000`
- backend should be reachable through `REACT_APP_BACKEND_REST_API_URL`

You can override the frontend port for Playwright if needed:

```bash
PLAYWRIGHT_FRONTEND_PORT=3001 npm run test:e2e
```

---

## Production build

```bash
npm run build
```

The production bundle is generated in:

```text
build/
```

---

## Docker

This repository includes Docker support for serving the built frontend with Nginx.

### Build image

```bash
docker build -t shorty-url-frontend .
```

### Run container

```bash
docker run --rm -p 8080:80 shorty-url-frontend
```

Then open:

```text
http://localhost:8080
```

---

## Authentication notes

- account pages are protected behind route guards
- sign-up requires `firstName`, `lastName`, `country`, `age`, `email`, and `password`
- sign-in uses email/password
- social auth buttons are currently placeholders and intentionally disabled

---

## Known limitations

- Google OAuth and GitHub OAuth are not wired yet
- profile editing is not fully implemented
- some feature documentation may still lag behind the code and should be updated incrementally
- full E2E success depends on a compatible running backend
